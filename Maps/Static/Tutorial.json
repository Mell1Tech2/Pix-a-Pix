"To Win this game you have to select the correct number of Dead Pixels",
"The Correct number of tiles you need to select is indicated inside the yellow flashing pixel",
"This number will go up or down depending on how many tiles you select or unselect",
"So keep an eye on it as you play",
"How do you know if the tiles you select are correct?",
"Well the columns and rows indicated by the double thick lines are the first clue",
"These indicate how many correct tiles are in each column or row",
"But wait there are question marks too inside these double thick lines pixels",
"When a question mark appears inside a column or row this indicates either",
"As indicated by the flashing Column square",
"As indicated by the flashing Row square",
"The Final part that helps you find the correct Dead Pixels is the Mirror",
"This square indicates the Mirror pattern",
"In this case it is a 4 sided mirror",
"this mean each quadrant repeats the same pattern on each other quadrant",
"Thank you for reading the tutorial",
"Now you can play the game"
